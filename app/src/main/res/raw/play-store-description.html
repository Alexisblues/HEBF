<b>A brief history:</b>
<i>Created in the midst of a broken heart, on top of this, the my device's battery was discharging fast and increasing my fury. Then the application was created in 2014 (before in shell) intended to improve battery life and performance of your phone.</i> - Ivsom Emídio.<br />

<b>Requirements:</b>
- A rooted phone
- Busybox installed (If it did not come with the root)
- Android 4.1+<br />

<b>Why do we need access to storage?</b>
We need to copy the necessary files for the application works, read them and then run them, furthermore, the "Cleaner" and "logging" feature, only work with this permission<br />

<b>Why do we need busybox?</b>
The busybox assures us that all commands will run on all versions of the system, it is a binary that gathers the most common binaries into one, so if one of them is missing on your system, it will be present in busybox.
